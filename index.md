<h2>Welcome to <i>i</i>CCF's documentation</h2>


This package provides clear and well-documented implementations

measured from the cross-correlation function (CCF).

When searching for exoplanets with the radial-velocity (RV) method,
these indicators are sometimes used as tracers of stellar activity.
